# Mobile_Sales_Dashboard
This Power BI project showcases a comprehensive analysis of mobile phone sales across India, using three interactive dashboards: a full-year overview, a focused monthly view for January 2022, and a comparative analysis across quarters and years. It highlights key metrics like total sales, transaction volume, average sales value, customer feedback, payment trends, and brand performance. Built using DAX, Power Query, and custom visuals, the dashboards offer valuable insights for retail decision-makers and demonstrate a strong grasp of data visualization best practices.
